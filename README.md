# Q-A-Chatbot-Using-Open-Source-LLM-s-using-Langchain-And-Ollama

A Q&A chatbot works by taking a user’s query, preprocessing it for clarity, and then passing it to a Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama, which interprets the intent using natural language processing. LangChain acts as the orchestration layer, managing conversation history, connecting to external knowledge sources through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and ensuring context-aware responses. If required, it fetches relevant information from databases or documents, combines it with the user’s query, and then the LLM generates a natural language response. The output is post-processed into a clear, user-friendly format and delivered back to the user, enabling seamless, accurate, and real-time conversational interactions.
